          <h3>Actor-Network Theory Returning to Dualism</h3>
          <br>
          <h5>Abstract</h5>
          <h6>This article shows that the call for the existence of networks differing only quantitatively from each other in Actor-Network Theory leads to dualism. This consists in the fact that, on one hand, it is impossible to determine which network will affect a discussed actant; on the other hand, that kind of network has to be known as a point of departure. This contributes - similarly to forms of dualism known in sociology - to intertwining of the two spheres. The assumption concerning the quantitative difference shows that opening to relations created by an actant cannot take place unless it is confined within the determined relations and the other way around. Therefore, calling for the existence of flat ontology is no longer an argument for the specific research perspective since it also does not exclude the theories criticized by  ANT. As the result, the thesis of a number of mobilized allies that is to be responsible for the success of actants is rejected.<span id="dots"></span></h6>

          <br>
          <h5>Introduction</h5>
          <p>One of the distinctive features of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) broadly emphasised withdrawal from dualism (Gad and Jensen, 2010: 61; Blok and Jensen, 2011: 12; Collin, 2011: 128; Harman, 2014: 35). Dualism is understood here as a product of such a distinction which creates two opposite and, simultaneously, complementary spheres, as, for instance, individual and society, micro- and macrostructure, nature and culture and many other (Law, 1999: 3). Each of these divisions leads to a paradox (Latour, 1993a: 30-34) that can be illustrated in the following way: nature moulds things belonging to culture, therefore, it goes beyond culture; but also – culture shapes things belonging to nature so it exceeds nature. Consequently, it is not surprising that in the history of sociology there have been repeated attempts of abandoning the dualistic division although the results became objects of controversy themselves, eventually leading to a conflict between – as Tero Piiroinen calls them (2014: 80) – antidualists and dualists. This article shows that an attempt of settling this dispute within ANT through ignoring traditional forms of dualism and calling for flat ontology was a failure.</p>
          <p>The existence of autonomous spheres, perceived as a product of modernity (Latour, 1999a) was supposed to be an obstacle to conducted research and flat ontology was to be an answer to its limitations thanks to blurring of boundaries between dually distinguished spheres (Latour, 2004: 36). If one is to determine two significant moments in the development of sociology of knowledge, one could be the formulation of the famous principle of symmetry by David Bloor (1976), the other – finding asymmetry with it by Bruno Latour (1992). The latter claimed that it is asymmetrical to explain both social and non-social things in the sociological categories (Latour, 1993a: 94-95). This leads to calling for the existence of hybrids: beings composed of mixed spheres traditionally recognized as autonomous, as, for instance, combining humans and nonhumans (Latour, 1994: 796-797). The origins of this trend are found by ANT creators in orientation to analysing scientific practices in contrast to the analysis of already moulded beings which are – as one can say using the language of this theory – after the process of purification (Callon, 1986). The condition of this, and also of abandoning traditional divisions, is to be irreductionism as a guiding principle of carrying out research (Harman, 2009: 12).</p>
          <p>Numerous consequences of abandoning the previously used divisions in sociology have been repeatedly mentioned, and these are: ignoring the issue of social inequalities which is in part due to rejection of the macrosociological sphere as an explaining category (Hornborg, 2016: 7); elimination of the difference between humans and nonhumans (Amsterdamska, 1990: 499; Riis, 2008: 295; Collins, 2010); naive realism (Collins and Yearley, 1992) or even – as the result of flat ontology - depriving actants of agency to the benefit of a network (Jansen, 2016: 3-4, 5). However, the analysis of the category of the length of the network as the basis for rejecting the previous divisions has not been carried out despite the fact that flat ontology is to cause it  (Blok and Jensen, 2011: 69). This article aims at filling this gap and the obtained results forced one to perceive the criticism of alternative theories (based on the traditional forms of dualism) offered within ANT as unjustified. Consequently, the thesis of the length of the network as a differentiating category is rejected.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Instead of dualism: hybrids and consequences</h5>
          <p>For the purposes of the presented study, two things have to be shown: what it means that a particular actant exists and how actants can be compared. In order to achieve that, one has to respond to Latour's call (2005: 12) – ‘to follow the actors themselves’ – and see them as the ones who are networks and create networks, and each addition or deduction of an actant changes the whole network (Callon, 1987: 93; Latour, 2011: 799), and thus the actants themselves since they do not exist beyond the relations they create (Latour, 2016: 315-316). Networks are composed of heterogeneous elements and this has two meanings.  Firstly, these are mixtures of humans and nonhumans (Latour, 1988b: 305). Secondly, as the result of translation – creating different connections during actants' operation – hybrids are made (e.g. Latour, 1993a: 51), that is, beings which cannot be unequivocally attributed to one sphere (therefore, the literature also mentions ‘hybrid nonhumans’ (Callon and Latour, 1992: 356)). As the first case shows objection to the Cartesian division into object and subject, separation of these meanings is solely analytical although the latter one also concerns other divisions.  According to Latour (1993a: 2): ‘for the others are multiplying, those hybrid articles that sketch out imbroglios of science, politics, economy, law, religion, technology, fiction. … All of culture and all of nature get churned up again every day’. Therefore, actor-network theory is to a great extent focused on showing that the particular solution would not be achieved without setting different actants to act (see Latour, 1991); and thus, what is traditionally called nature has the same influence on the course of experiment as researcher's actions (Latour, 1987: 77). Finding oneself in the middle is a permanent element of ANT, hence, it is impossible to even discuss a greater participation in a particular network of one of segments of dualism (Latour, 1999c: 36). This is rooted in things already mentioned in the classic work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1986: 27): starting research in the fashion of anthropologists, that is, abandoning the interpretation frameworks gained from one's own culture (tradition). Therefore, when one analyses a network of connections of institutions (macrostructure) and private individuals (microstructure) this does not mean that the former one would have a bigger influence thanks to adherence to macrostructure itself (Latour, Jensen, Venturini et al., 2012: 590-591). Attributes of macrostructural actants may also concern the ones belonging to a microstructure (Callon and Latour, 1981: 286).</p>
          <p>To acknowledge the significance of these comments, one should return to the nature/culture dualism. This was of key significance when the task of sociology of knowledge was explaining all the things which turned out to be false in science. Consequently, nature and culture were to provide qualitatively different explanations for qualitatively different cases (Latour, 1993a: 95), and an attempt of breaking the status quo ended with accusations of sociological reductionism (Laudan, 1981) or – on the opposite side – indication that referring to nature in explaining the success of science inevitably leads to teleological reasoning and not causality (Bloor, 1973: 183). It is hard to use both these arguments against the offers of actor-network theory which seems to be an advantage of flat ontology. Therefore, the length of the network is to be responsible for the fact that certain achievements of science are successful and others are not, since networks differ only in length (a number of mobilized allies): ‘in other words, the differences are sizeable, but they are only of size. … The collectives are all similar, except for their size, like the successive helixes of a single spiral’. (Latour, 1993a: 108).</p>
          <p>One should bear in mind that it is difficult to find such a systematic exposition of the aforementioned idea in Latour's works as in the case of his criticism of dualism. He is more willing to use the category of network to show its heterogeneity than compare hybrids. However, when he does that, the comparison is done, first of all, to emphasise that different position of actants is related to different results: ‘the social context of the nineteenth century is altered according to whether it is made up of wretched souls or poor people infected by microbes’ (Latour, 1993a: 4). Second, it is done to claim that the length of the network determines the magnitude of actants' impact: ‘If Pasteur stays too long inside his laboratory … people could say: “Well after all, it was just an interesting curiosity!”’ (Latour, 1983: 150). I will be interested in this latter case.</p>
          <p>This can be understood in a way that it only gives an account of the fact that without the specific allies the particular effect would not be achieved, which could be confirmed by another Latour's statement (1983: 150): ‘Pasteur … was an expert at fostering interest groups and persuading their members that their interests were inseparable from his own’. This particularly means that the Pasteur's (and any actants’ in general) success results from the mobilization of selected allies – that without French breeders it would be impossible even if more other allies were mobilised. Accordingly, this interpretation, which could be called a poor one, would mean impossibility of discussing having consequences by the length of the network, privileging particular actants. Therefore, by discussing interest groups, Latour means exactly interest groups in general, actants which could become allies, and not simply French breeders. A poor interpretation of Latour's example would lead to qualitative differences; a radical one enables one to transform them into quantitative differences.</p>
          <p>Therefore, hybrids can be compared to each other with regard to the scale of mobilization of allies, but the allies themselves have to be consequently perceived also as hybrids – one cannot say that some networks are composed of a greater number of actants coming from culture and other are not. The scale of mobilization may be understood as referring to authorities in a scientific article: a number of reference books would determine the length of the network (Latour, 1986: 22). Obviously, there is no need to explain here that a greater number of references is not the only factor influencing the impact of a scientific article, and it is sometimes the other way around: too many references may give rise to uncertainty concerning the text's value, suggesting eclecticism; and in other cases this may be of no significance at all. Therefore, comparison of hybrids, although different lengths of network are to have different consequences, has to be relativized to the third actant to which certain differences have a (specific) meaning. Before answering the question of the way of understanding causing different consequences, one should discuss other issue: why are they so important?</p>
          <p>So far, it has been shown how one can compare actants to each other within ANT; still, there is also an issue of their existence. Actants change in a process of translation, that is, depending on what allies are included in a network (Law, 2004: 42), and the description of such actants itself co-creates the network (Latour, 2005: 33). In this sense, the allies – according to distinction between mediators and intermediaries (Callon, 1991) – are mediators modifying relations between actants (Latour, 1996a: 240; 2002). The existence not causing consequences, criticized by Latour (1999b: 117) shows why the latter one is so significant. Therefore, actants are distinguished thanks to the fact that they have influence on each other (Latour, 1999c: 119), and their existence in isolation is impossible (Latour, 1988a: 108-109). An act understood in that way, having agency, does not require an additional assumption concerning intentionality (Sayes, 2014: 139); therefore, when the previous paragraph mentioned the third actant to which certain differences do matter, this is again nothing more than causing consequences. Since it is impossible to determine how a certain ally will change a network in advance, distinguishing this third actant also has to take place through investigation, that is, verification, if a change  has occurred – the actant exists when it works (Latour, 2014). The very concept of distinguishing actants with regard to their impact is, consequently, inseparably related to the principle of irreductionism.</p>
          <p>It may seem that the answer to the question of consequences is very simple. Indeed, it is simple – the statement that if an actant's state changes under the influence of other actant, this latter actant have influenced the former one does not need special additional explanations. On the other hand, things get a little complicated if one introduces the third actant to the discussion and starts comparing actants as networks of different lengths. Continuing on the example of the scientific article: let's assume that a reader has two articles of different number of references and uses each of them for different studies he is working on. Undoubtedly, there have to be different consequences. However, if the example is modified and the reader shows his friend only one article, e.g. the one with a greater number of references, then it is certain that the reader's friend will be influenced by only one article. The significance of the emphasised distinction will be clear in the next part of the article in which the second of the offered understandings of causing consequences will play a key part.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Returning to dualism: length of network and consequences</h5>
          <p>Let there be two vaccines: A and B. There was one test run on vaccine B and two on vaccine A. A number of tests corresponds with the length of the network created by the vaccines. The effect of quantitative difference is the fact that A vaccine can be found in S store - this is another actant added to this network. These three sentences forming an initial description of an example have to satisfy the definition of actant-network together with emphasising consequences it is causing. Still, have these consequences been properly positioned as the influence only one network has on the third actant (store S)? I understand 'the third actant' as any actant which is influenced and this influence can be discussed.</p>
          <p>This problem is analogous to the situation with the reader's friend discussed above and it is about time to solve it. Firstly, one should notice that if both networks add the same actant this will not be caused by a quantitative difference – despite the fact that one network will be shorter and the other one will be longer, the consequence they cause would be the same. Consequently, this possibility should be rejected as conflicting with the assumptions of actor-network theory. The shorter and longer networks would therefore either influence different actants or have different influences on the same actant.</p>
          <p>Let there be that A vaccine, as the result of it's being subject to two tests, can be found in S store, and B vaccine, subject to one experiment, is placed in a military storage warehouse. If the networks have influenced different actants, these actants – if they are actually different – have to cause different consequences. Let there be that a consumer takes a look at A vaccine in store S and a soldier takes a look at B vaccine in a military unit. Have these consequences been caused by a quantitative difference? If so, it would not matter if A vaccine is placed in store S and B vaccine in a military storage warehouse but a number of actants included in networks. However, if networks include one actant each this will not be caused by a quantitative difference between them since quantitative difference would not cause consequences. Therefore, including different actants cannot be caused by a quantitative difference and this concerns both S store and the military storage warehouse, both the consumer and the soldier.</p>
          <p>This means that the length of the network causes different consequences only when one of the networks influences the third actant, and the other does not show any influence. If the third actant is to be S store then one of the vaccines has to be available there (and the other does not). It has been assumed that this would be A vaccine.</p>
          <p>It is easy to notice that the situation with the influence of one network and lack of this influence of the other has already taken place in the case of the second experiment, which, generally, enables one to discuss a quantitative difference (networks of different length).  Accordingly, the solution of the aforementioned problem could not be calling for other scale of availability of A and B vaccines in store S – as there still would be the actant which is influenced by one of the networks and not influenced by the other since this is the condition for discussing a quantitative difference.</p>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>Length of network as the result of choosing the third actant</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let the starting point be that a longer network (the one which has more allies) influences the third actant. Let me show the reader that accepting this assumption involves defining the length of the network only by the third actant which inclusion in the network is currently discussed, and not by previously included actants. How can one interpret that? The part presenting actor-network theory's establishments concerning dualism presented the example of the number of references determining the length of the network. It was stated that the selection of the point of departure (the third actant) determines whether this criterion is of significance, therefore, the length of the network is dependent on the selection of the third actant. For instance, publishing one's own literary work on the Internet may be the cause of a certain publishing house's refusal to print it; consequently, expanding the network by certain medium does not mean that this network will always be longer than an alternative network.</p>
          <p>However, I will try to give a counterexample. Let there be such an actant – the second experiment – which makes that B vaccine cannot be found in S store. Since it has been established that a longer network influences the third actant (more mobilized allies), in this case it means that the second experiment is the cause for the network of A vaccine to be longer than the network of B vaccine. If the second experiment determines which network is longer than why has it been added to this and not the other network? The accepted assumption requires that the answer would be: since this particular network has been already longer. However, if it is the second experiment which determined the length of the networks than the network of A vaccine could not be longer before. Consequently, the length of the network could not be the reason for adding the second experiment to the network of vaccine A. It is inconsistent with the assumption that influencing the third actant depends on a greater number of mobilized allies.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I have been successful in proving that if only a longer network influences the third actant, then it is impossible to give such an actant which would be the reason for recognizing a certain network as a longer one regardless of what subsequent actants will appear. In other words, if only a longer network influences the third actant, it is impossible to tell which network is longer when knowing the actants included in both networks but before including the third actant.</p>
          <br>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>The influence of network of a higher number of mobilised allies as a condition for causing consequences by a quantitative difference.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Certainly, each proof is a function of an asked question and, consequently, accepted assumptions. However, there is no need to ask here whether actor-network theory assumes that the third actant is influenced by only a longer network or whether this influence simply depends on a quantitative difference. The former assumption results from the latter one.</p>
          <p>Let there be that the influence on the third actant results from a quantitative difference. In order for it not to be equivalent to the assumption that the third actant is influenced by a longer network, there has to be an actant which is influenced by a shorter network and not by a longer one. Let me show the reader that this is impossible.</p>
          <p>If a shorter network may influence the third actant this means that there is an actant which belongs to a shorter network but does not belong to a longer network. However, this state is to result from a quantitative difference – here is why the existence of a longer and shorter network was assumed at the beginning. So there is an actant which belongs to a shorter network but not to a longer network. Still, if a network which does not have influence on this actant is a longer network then it has to influence (include) other actant which has not been included by a shorter network (this is the actant which enables one to discuss a quantitative difference - of a longer and shorter network). However, the networks have been referred to different actants and, as it has been already shown, the cause of the influence cannot be a quantitative difference then. Similarly, when the third actant is added to both networks this cannot happen due to a quantitative difference.</p>
          <p>Consequently, if the influence on the third actant results from a quantitative difference, it results from a greater number of mobilized allies.</p>
          <br>
          <ol start="2">
            <li>Length of network as the result of the already added actants.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Verifying that a shorter network may influence the third actant required assuming such a possibility. In other case, it would be impossible to question the influence only by a longer network. A shorter network might influence the third actant under one condition – that its inclusion would not make it recognizable as a longer network. This would be contrary to the establishment form the first section but there is nothing exceptional about it - that conclusion was based on the assumption concerning the influence of only a longer network. Yet it turned out that if a quantitative difference is to be the cause of the influence on the third actant, this has to be the influence of a longer network.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, this leads to the different characteristics of a network than the one resulting from the first section. Let me show that the third actant may be included only to the network to which the previous actants have been added. However, this proof is possible with a broader assumption than the proof describing the length of the network as the result of choosing the third actant. Let there be that the assumption on the influence caused by a quantitative difference involves the assumption related to the influence of a longer network. According to the establishment from A section, this assumption is justified.</p>
          <p>There is a longer and shorter network. A longer network is two experiments, a shorter one - one experiment. Is the first experiment dependent on both networks? If so, then its adding could not be caused by a quantitative difference, it is therefore impossible according to the accepted assumption.  The first experiment can neither belong to a shorter network without simultaneously belonging to a longer network. If it cannot belong to a shorter network without simultaneously belonging to a longer network and it cannot be included in both networks, it has to be included only in a longer network. Generally, this conclusion has to concern any actant. Otherwise, there would be an actant which would belong only to a shorter network or to both networks but this would not be caused by a quantitative difference - and this would, in turn, be inconsistent with the accepted assumption.</p>
          <p>Therefore, any actant which is influenced and this influence is discussed, has to be influenced by the network which has already influenced other actant. Since the point of departure was the assumption concerning the existence of a quantitative difference, the actant which has already been influenced by a network, has to be known as a point of departure because it is the condition for the existence of a quantitative difference (the same as in the case of the second experiment). The fact which network is longer, thus influences the third actant, is not the result of choosing the third actant, but an axiom.</p>
          <br>
          <ol type="A" start="2">
            <li>The length of the network as the result of choosing the third actant/the length of the network as the result of the already added actants.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>While the conclusion from the first section enabled one to claim that the third actant would be influenced by a longer network, this would not allow one to say which network is longer prior to the observation of the influence on the third actant.  What is more, the conclusion from the second section also enabled one to say that a longer network would influence the third actant, but here the length of the network is known before the observations. Nonetheless, it is impossible to tell which conclusion is right – both of them, although rooted in different assumptions, are necessary to be accepted if one wants to discuss the consequences of a quantitative difference. It would be impossible to accept the assumption of influencing the third actant by a higher number of mobilized allies and, simultaneously, reject the assumption of the influence of a quantitative difference – the latter one leads to the former one. Similarly, it would be impossible to accept the assumption concerning the influence of a quantitative difference and reject the assumption of the influence of a higher number of mobilized allies – the former one leads to the latter one.</p>
          <p>Despite these difficulties, the characteristics of a network is possible. To achieve that, let me return to the relationship between the two contrary conclusions. It is known that a shorter network does exist; therefore, although on one hand it cannot influence any actants, at least one actant belongs to a shorter network. Let me prove that a shorter network includes the same actants as a longer network except for one actant which only belongs to a longer network.</p>
          <p>Let there be a network of B vaccine composed of one experiment, and a network of A vaccine composed of two experiments and S store. The aim is to prove that the second experiment also belongs to B vaccine. According to the second conclusion, since the second experiment was added to one of the networks, this network has to be longer. What is the reason for recognising this network as a longer one? The second experiment. But why the second experiment has been influenced by this particular network and not some other one?  If the second experiment is the reason for the length of the network, it could not be added to the particular network because it was a shorter network before. Nonetheless, it is inconsistent with the assumption of causing consequences by a quantitative difference and the assumption of causing consequences by a network of a higher number of mobilized allies. Therefore, if the second experiment is to exist and cannot be the reason for a quantitative difference, it has to belong to both networks. Consequently, the network of vaccine B is composed of two experiments, and the network of A vaccine is composed of two experiments and S store. But why does S store belong to the network of A vaccine? Because this network  was to be longer before; accordingly, the second experiment has to belong only to the network of vaccine A.  This contradiction is indefeasible.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, none of these conclusions would be possible if there wasn't for the assumption of a quantitative difference. Let there be that S store belongs to both networks; therefore, there is no quantitative difference. Has it been added to a shorter network because the length of the network is the result of choosing the third actant? If so, then this adding would cause that a shorter network would become a longer one.  Still, it is not true since it has been assumed that the networks do not differ in length after including S store. Consequently, S store could not be added to a shorter network according to the conclusion from the first section. Has it been added to a shorter network because the length of the network is the result of the previously included actants?  If so, it could not be added to a shorter network since the actant which is influenced and the influence is discussed can be only added to the network which is a longer one. Accordingly, S store could not be added to a shorter network also according to the conclusion from the second section.</p>
          <p>A quantitative difference, although it has to exist, it cannot be determined by more than one actant; otherwise, it would be impossible to reduce it on the basis of the conclusion from the first section. So if both conclusions are still valid (negation of one of them is impossible without the negation of both), a quantitative difference has to be minimal. This is an extremely significant establishment: if there is one actant enabling one to discuss a quantitative difference, there can only be two networks.</p>
          <br>
          <ol type="A" start="3">
            <li>Dualism</li>
          </ol>
          <p>There are two networks: a shorter one - of vaccine B (two experiments); a longer one - of vaccine A (two experiments and S store). In the sociological tradition, dualism has led to assuming a certain actant's adherence to a particular sphere of dualism (Latour, 1993b: 376-377), and then to asking whether this actant has been influenced by an actant belonging to the same sphere or to the opposite one. As the result, as the answer indicates the opposite sphere, this has led to a paradox. For instance, it was assumed that institution I belongs to a macrostructure (which is justified, since knowing actants composing the network one can say to which network institution I was included) and the question was what formed it (that is, the actant of which sphere influenced it) to know if it really belonged to the macrostructure (which is also justified since knowing actants composing the network one cannot say to which of those Institution I will be included since the third actant determines the length of the network). Similarly, the actant was chosen which was assumed to belong to microstructure and an analogous question was asked. Consequently, attributing an actant to a particular sphere would not be possible if it infinitely circulates among them (Jensen, 2007).</p>
          <p>What is it that has an influence on S store? If it is an actant belonging to a longer network this means that this network was longer before S store was added to it; however, it is untrue since S store precedes the second experiment also belonging to a shorter network. This situation would be contrary to the fact that the length of the network may be known before the third actant is added to it. Accordingly, S store must have been influenced by an actant belonging to a shorter network since there are only two networks and one of them must have influenced the third actant if a quantitative difference is to cause the consequences.</p>
          <p>What is it that has an influence on the second experiment belonging to a shorter network? If it is an actant belonging to a shorter network, that means that the second experiment is the cause of recognizing this network as a shorter one (that is, prior to adding of the second experiment it was impossible to determine which network is shorter). However, this is untrue – the second experiment also belongs to a longer network so it cannot be the reason for a quantitative difference. This situation would be contrary to the fact that the length of the network is known before adding of the third actant. Therefore, the second experiment had to be influenced by an actant belonging to a shorter network, as there are only two networks, and one of them must have influenced the third actant if a quantitative difference is to cause the consequences.</p>
          <p>Things belonging to a longer network and things belonging to a shorter network are mutually exceeding.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Conclusion: a dream of a certain theory</h5>
          <p>ANT is more of methodology than theory (Law, 2006: 83, 2009: 141; Mol, 2010: 255-256). The essence of this statement comes down to avoidance of a priori assumptions concerning possible relationships formed by actants (Latour, 1996b: 375) – these assumptions are effects of created networks (as the division into nature and culture) (Latour, 1992: 281) so they cannot function as the reasons for phenomena (e.g. acceptance of a certain theory) since they are also the results of translation (Law, 1992: 386, 2002: 91; Law and Mol, 1995: 277). First of all, the point of departure that is to enable such characteristics of ANT is proper – flat ontology constitutes the most radical opening up to actants. Any alternative means establishing qualitative differences between actants and thus limitations concerning the relationships they form. Second, such a point of departure leads to dualism, that is, the existence of mutually exclusive spheres – if flat ontology means opening up to the relationships formed by actants, this also means closing actants in the particular relationships. Thus, if ANT calls for a certain research perspective defining it as a consistent with opening up to actants, this perspective has to be based on flat ontology. Still, flat ontology implies relevance of also other perspectives, contrary to this opening up.</p>
          <p>These statements enable one to scrutinize the thesis of causing consequences by a number of mobilized allies. The criticism of the theories contrary to ANT was based on the conviction that a quantitative difference is to be responsible for the observed phenomena, including accepting one theory and rejecting the other one. However, a quantitative difference cannot lead to that because even if ANT as a scientific theory created a longer network, there still would be no reason for negation of theories contrary to it (which created a shorter networks), postulating a limitation of research to an analysis of specific relationships, e.g. dividing actants into nature and culture to deal with relationships within only one sphere. Consequently, the thesis that the length of the network causes consequences (e.g. is responsible for success or failure of a certain scientific theory) is not valid as this is not an excluding category.</p>
          <p>All this is not an argument for negation of the achievements of ANT within the scope of discussing new relationships created by actants, and its originality comes from a new limitation of the set of relationships. This is not a surprising thesis – in his conversation with Nocholas Gane (2004: 79-80), Latour explicitly claims that his goal is not an objection to all dichotomies, and some of them are even useful in his opinion. However, the essence of the obtained results is showing that flat ontology does not exclude any perspective since it does not cause any consequences. Actor-network theory returning to dualism means returning to the point of departure; and the criticism of different perspectives in sociology offered by this theory means participation in the long-discussed form of this discipline (cf. Karakayali, 2015) where a quantitative difference cannot be an argument.</p>
